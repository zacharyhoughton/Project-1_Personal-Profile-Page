        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Although my experience as a web developer is limited, my military experience has instilled in me many desirable qualities that employers are looking for in a web developer. As a Squad Leader and eventually a Lead Petty Officer (LPO), I was overall responsible for a 12 person Force Protection Team. This groomed me into a solid leader and mentor who could execute high-risk training without error. As a web developer this directly transfers into experience needed to lead high stress design projects for whoever our client may be.</p>
        <p>Additionally, my military experience put me in situations where I learned to adapt to constant changes in schedules, making me immune to last minute design changes or deadlines that may arise.</p>
        <p>As previously mentioned I may be fairly new to a career in web development, but what I lack in experience I more than make up for with my leadership, discipline, and never quit attitude. These are character traits that can't be faked or ignored so if youâ€™re looking for someone to learn and grow with your company, im your guy!</p> 
        <p>Your Future Web Developer,</p>
